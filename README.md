Why Airbnb?

Data Cleaning
Initially, the data was very messy and uncleaned, so we used external tools to prepare it for visualization. Data cleaning has been done using Jupyter Notebook and Tableau Prep. Finally, the cleaned datasets of both the cities are merged in Jupyter Notebook to get the ‘Final Dataset’ which has been used for doing the visualizations.

Visualization Tool
Tableau has been used as the Data Visualization tool as it is a very powerful, secure and flexible end to end analytics platform where we can visualize our data quickly and easily by creating interactive dashboards and convey an overall story using storyboard. Tableau is been used predominantly in the industry for creating powerful visualizations.

Target Audience The insights drawn could be helpful for both Hosts and Users. Hosts- People putting up their place for rental purposes. Users- People searching for accommodation.

Dashboard has been categorized into four categories-
